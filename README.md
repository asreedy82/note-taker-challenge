# Note Taker

## Description

This application allows a user to create and delete notes, and it also saves the notes and displays them to the side. In building this application, I was able to develop my skills in Express routes even further.

## Installation

In order to use this application, Express needs to be installed. To install Express, first run `npm init -y` then run `npm i express`. I also use an npm package `uniqid`. To install that, run `npm i uniqid`. Then run `node server.js` to have the app listen to port 3001. Then open the webpage here: [Link to page](http://localhost:3001/)

## Usage

The application is designed for a small business owner to be able to take notes and save them to keep track of tasks.
